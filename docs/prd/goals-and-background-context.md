# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Automate vocabulary gap identification for middle school educators, reducing manual analysis time
- Provide personalized, grade-appropriate vocabulary recommendations (grades 6-12) based on student writing samples and transcripts
- Enable educators to track student vocabulary progression over time with clear visualizations
- Build a privacy-compliant system that securely stores student data while maintaining educator access
- Deliver subject-aware recommendations (ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies) that fit student writing contexts
- Track adoption of recommended vocabulary in subsequent student work to measure effectiveness

## Background Context

Middle school educators face a significant challenge in personalizing vocabulary development for students. Manual analysis of student writing and conversation transcripts is time-consuming and often fails to provide targeted recommendations aligned with each student's proficiency level. This lack of personalized vocabulary instruction can hinder language acquisition and academic performance.

The Personalized Vocabulary Recommendation Engine addresses this gap by leveraging AI to automatically analyze student text input, build dynamic vocabulary profiles, and generate grade-appropriate word recommendations. By using Common Core vocabulary standards and grade-level word lists (6th-12th grade), the system provides recommendations that educators trust and students can realistically adopt. The system will track vocabulary usage over time, providing insights into student growth and the effectiveness of recommendations.
