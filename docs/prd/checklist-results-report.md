# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall PRD Completeness:** 95%
- **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right
- **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready
- **Most Critical Gaps:**
  - Word list compilation methodology needs more specificity (addressed as developer responsibility)
  - Out-of-scope items now explicitly listed above
  - Stakeholder approval process not defined

## Category Analysis

| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PASS    | None - clear problem statement, target users, success metrics |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | Well-bounded MVP, clear feature prioritization through epic structure |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PASS    | Comprehensive UI/UX goals, accessibility WCAG AA, platform targets clear |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | 26 FRs covering all core functionality, specific and testable |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS    | 26 NFRs with specific performance targets, security, scalability |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS    | 5 epics, 31 stories, properly sequenced with clear acceptance criteria |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | Detailed tech stack, Supabase + FastAPI architecture, clear constraints |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PASS    | Database schema, S3 integration, LangChain setup all documented |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | Well-structured, consistent terminology, clear rationale throughout |

## Final Decision

✅ **READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.

**Strengths:**
- Clear problem definition with specific target users
- Well-scoped MVP with logical epic progression
- Comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements
- Detailed story breakdown with testable acceptance criteria
- Technical stack decisions made and justified
- Security and privacy considerations well-addressed

**Next Steps:**
1. Hand off to architect for detailed architecture design
2. Architect creates system architecture diagram, database schema, API specifications
3. Begin Epic 1 implementation after architecture review
