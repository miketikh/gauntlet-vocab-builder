# Out of Scope for MVP

To clarify project boundaries, the following items are explicitly **OUT of scope** for the MVP release:

- Real-time speech-to-text transcription (assumes educators provide pre-processed text documents)
- Direct integration with Learning Management Systems (Google Classroom, Canvas, Schoology)
- Student-facing interface (MVP is educator-only dashboard)
- Mobile native applications (iOS/Android apps - web responsive only)
- Gamification features for students (badges, leaderboards, points)
- Multi-language support (English vocabulary only in MVP)
- Automated email/push notifications (manual review workflow only)
- Bulk data import from existing systems (manual student/document entry)
- Advanced analytics (cohort analysis, longitudinal studies - basic progress tracking only)
- Custom vocabulary word list creation by educators (uses pre-compiled Common Core lists only)
